Tests:
If we query and change the time of an element so that it would come up
in a different position in the next query, we must still be able to 
refer to that task by the same id (test if menu is not a set)

Tests whether you can modify a task that was added to the menu
when it was in the future but is now part of the past

Tests whether you can edit a task's clock to the past

Test whether you can edit a task's clock to an existing task
