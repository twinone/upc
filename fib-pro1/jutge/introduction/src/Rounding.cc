/**
Statement:
Write a program that reads a real number x≥0 and prints ⌊ x ⌋ (the floor of x), ⌈ x ⌉ (the ceiling of x), and the rounding of x.

Input

Input consists of a real number x ≥ 0.

Output

Print the floor of x, the ceiling of x, and the integer number closer to x (⌈ x ⌉ if there is a tie).
*/

/**
Note there is an error in the Statement or examples.
The statement says if there's a tie rounding, round down, but the example actually rounds 4.5 to 5.

As the examples are probably run by an approved solution, I'll implement the case of the example.
