#include <iostream>

/**
Statement:
Let n be any strictly positive natural number. Consider the following process. If n is an even number, we divide it by two. Otherwise, we multiply it by 3 and add 1 to it. When we reach 1, we stop. For instance, starting with 3, we obtain the sequence

3,  10,  5,  16,  8,  4,  2,  1 .
Since 1937 it is conjectured that this process ends for any initial n, although nobody has been able to prove it. In this problem, we do not ask you for a proof. You only have to write a program that prints the number of steps that it takes to reach 1 for every given n.

Input

Input consists of several natural numbers n â‰¥ 1.

Output

For every n, print how many steps are needed to reach 1. Suppose that this number is well defined, that is, that the conjecture of the statement is true.
