/**
Statement:
Write a program that reads sequences with all the numbers between 1 and n but one, and tells which one is missing.

Input

Input consists of several sequences. Every sequence begins with a number n between 1 and 104 followed by n âˆ’ 1 natural numbers. Every number between 1 and n appears exactly once, except one of them, which is missing.

Output

For every sequence, print the missing number.
