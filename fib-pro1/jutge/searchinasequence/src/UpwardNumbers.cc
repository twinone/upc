#include <iostream>

/**
Statement:
We say that a natural number is upward if its digits fulfill the following property: on the right of a 0 can only be a 1, on the right of a 1 can only be a 2, on the right of a 2 can only be a 3, â€¦, on the right of a 8 can only be a 9 and on the right of a 9 can only be a 0. For instance, 34567 and 8901 are upward, but 1223 and 245 are not.

Your task is to write a program that, given a sequence of natural numbers, indicates if this contains two or more consecutive upward numbers.

Your program must include the function
