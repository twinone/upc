My solution to "The Game"

Ranked #34 out of 173 participants. I wanted to prove you can get a good ranking without using graph algorithms, so the solution is very lengthy and can be easily beaten by a simple DFS/BFS.

Note that you can use this code to base your own on it, but remember [Jutge](https://www.jutge.org) has an automated cheating detector, so if you're gonna copy it, make sure to change some stuff.
